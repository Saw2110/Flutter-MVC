# Basic MVC Flutter Project

The Basic MVC Flutter Project is a fundamental Flutter application designed with the primary objective of offering a practical learning experience and enabling the exploration of new concepts in Flutter development.

## Project Structure

The project adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.

### Controller Folder

The **controller** folder is dedicated to housing various controllers responsible for handling the application's logic and data flow. Controllers act as the brain of the application, managing interactions between the model and view components.

### View Folder

The **view** folder encompasses all the UI elements and screens of the application. Here, developers create user interfaces that users will interact with, making it a crucial part of the project.

### Model Folder

The **model** folder serves as a vital link between the controllers and views. It facilitates seamless communication by relaying data between the two components.

**Note:**This project structure encourages developers to write clean and organized code, making it easier to comprehend and scale the application. The actual code implementation is available within each respective folder of the project.
